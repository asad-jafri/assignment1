# The goal of this project was to construct, analyze, and publish a dataset on data.world. I did this by first collecting and processing data from two sources. The first source was a dataset that included the amount of times a certain country was mentioned in the New York Times from the years 2000 to 2016. The second dataset included the countries' respective population, land mass, and density. These two datasets were combined to create a novel dataset. Then, the data was analyzed through a graph where the country (on x-axis) was listed against the number of occurences in the publications (on the y-axis). The license for the project was a MIT license. A source of bias may have been not including the countries' wealth in the data, as this may have had an impact on the number of times it was mentioned in the publications. This may have been a valuable variable.
